This is a repo of the files I used to create the Salt River Subbasin relative elevation model found on my website.

The REM was created using OpenTopography's RiverRem package (https://github.com/OpenTopography/RiverREM).

Shapefile of the subbasin: SaltRiverREM/Resources/SaltRiver.shp

DEM of the subbasin: SaltRiverREM/Resources/saltriver.tif
